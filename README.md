# Solution Assistant

Dynamics 365 Solution Assistant is an Electron.js based app to provide a UI solution packager with additional feature planned. (WIP)

# Development Build

To run the development build open two terminal windows and navigate to the project root directory.

- In one terminal window type <code> npm start </code>
  - Launches the react site on port 3000 of localhost
- In the other terminal window type <code> npm run electron </code>
  - Starts the electron shell

Note that your browser will display an error related to electron and will not display the site, only the Electron shell will display the application.
