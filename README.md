# Solution Assistant

Dynamics 365 Solution Assistant is an Electron.js based app to provide a UI solution packager with additional feature planned. (WIP)

# Development Build

Build command simplified from 2 steps to one. Now just run
<code> npm run electron-dev </code>

Note that your browser will display an error related to electron and will not display the site, only the Electron shell will display the application.
